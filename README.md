# Main JavaScript concepts

The goal of this repository is to present the main concepts of the Javascript language.
There are "articles", examples and a prez folder that contains a subset of the same subjects of the articles but more appropriate if you want to present a concept as a speaker.

Concepts explained :

- asynchronous JS : callsatck, message queue, event loop (just in prez/ for now)
- The two phases : compilation and execution

Coming :

- hoisting
- scope
- clojure
- object and its properties
- prototype (and class)
- this
- promises
- async / await
- iterator
- generator
- Functionnal operators : map, filter, reduce
- ECMAScript and TC39
