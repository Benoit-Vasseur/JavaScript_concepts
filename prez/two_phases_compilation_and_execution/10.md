And here the code annotated with the lexical scope work of the compiler

```js
var foo = "bar"; // I have a foo variable declared in the global scope
var bam;
 
function bar() { // I have a function declaration bar in the global scope
    var foo = "baz"; // I have a foo variable declaration in the bar scope
 
    function baz(foo) { // I have a have a function declaration baz in the bar scope AND I have a variable declaration foo (parameter of the function)
      foo = "bam";
      bam = "yay";
    }
    baz();
}
 
bar();
foo;
bam;
baz();
```
