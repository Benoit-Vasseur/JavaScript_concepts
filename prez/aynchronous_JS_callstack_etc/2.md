# How Does Synchronous JavaScript Work?

Before asynchronous, let's talk synchronous Javascript

```js
function second {
  console.log('Hello there!');
}
function first {
  console.log('Hi there!');
  second();
  console.log('The End');
}

first();
```

Javascript use a single stack (LIFO), named "call stack", to run the code.

So let's see how this code is executed !
