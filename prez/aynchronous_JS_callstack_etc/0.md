# The main characteristics of Javascript

- the only language that run in the browser
- implements a standard called ECMAScript which evolves thanks to the Technical Committee 39
- can run in two environments : browser and NodeJs
- Lot of Functionnal Programming aspects
- Lots of weird behaviors (null and undefined, NaN, etc)
- single-threaded programming language

  -> only one thing can happen at a time

  - But we can perform a network request without blocking, right ?

    -> Yes -> asynchronous : thanks to some mechanisms
