# What about asynchronous ?

Let's suppose we are doing a network call :

```js
function networkRequest(url) {
  /**
  * requesting network resource
  **/
  return someData;
}
function greeting() {
  console.log('Hello World');
}

networkRequest('www.somerandomurl.com');
greeting();
```

Will networkRequest() do its job in the stack ?
  Well if it does, the main thread will be block until the request is done

  So no it does not.
  -> It uses other mechanisms (some additions)
